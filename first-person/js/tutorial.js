/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   INTERACTIVE TUTORIAL — a 30-step guided walkthrough of the first-person city.

   Ported from 2D js/tutorial.js, but the 2D version could only ever point at
   DOM buttons: in 2D the whole city IS the viewport, so "look at the port" is a
   camera pan. Here half the curriculum is about things you do with your body
   (WASD, mouse look, jump, walk up to a door and press E), so the step list is
   split three ways:

     • DOM steps      — spotlight a HUD element with a cut-out overlay
     • world steps    — ease the camera to a landmark and narrate it
     • concept steps  — centred card, no target (controls, modes, keys)

   The cut-out is four surrounding divs rather than a radial-gradient mask: the
   hole then passes real pointer events through, and it stays crisp on every
   browser without a compositing layer per frame.

   Camera flights take the camera away from the player. `G.tourMode` is the
   existing "the camera is not yours right now" flag — Player.update() bails on
   it and the pointer-lock listener stops treating an unlock as a pause — so we
   raise it for the duration instead of inventing a second one. Everything the
   tutorial touches (camera transform, player enabled/yaw/pitch, minimap
   visibility, tourMode) is snapshotted on start and put back on stop.

   Runs once per browser (localStorage 'sc_fp_tutorial_done'), never under
   ?autostart=1 (headless screenshots), and is re-runnable from the pause menu.
   Force it with ?tutorial=1.
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */
import { G } from './state.js';

const DONE_KEY = 'sc_fp_tutorial_done';

/* Read at render time, not module load: main.js decides G.touchMode during
   boot (and `?touch=1` can force it), which happens after this module is
   imported. The UA sniff stays as the fallback for the case where the
   walkthrough somehow runs before boot has set the flag. */

    if (typeof G.touchMode === 'boolean') return G.touchMode;

/* Camera framing for a subject building. Exported because daily_briefing.js
   frames the same landmarks and both were previously wrong in the same way:
   Tour._stopPos-style constants (stand 200 out, float at y≈100, aim at y≈90)
   were written when nothing was taller than a few floors. After the skyline
   pass bld_g is 864 units tall, so a fixed low camera pitches 30–45° DOWN and
   fills the frame with pavement while the tower clips the edge.

   So derive everything from the subject: back off until its full height covers
   ~75% of the vertical FOV, sit at 62% of its height and aim at 50%. That puts
   the horizon near the middle of the frame for a tower and keeps a squat data
   centre from being framed as if it were one. Footprint sets the floor on the
   distance so a wide, low building is not clipped by its own edges. */
