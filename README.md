# 🏙️ Singularity City

**The entire AI industry — alive in your browser.**

A globally synced, real-time pixel-art simulation where every AI model is a citizen, every lab is a district, and every benchmark, launch, and price war happens in real time. Built with PixiJS 7, Three.js r128, and vanilla JS — zero bundler, ~97 JS files, ~63K lines.

## Features

### 🌦️ Dynamic Weather & Climate Zones
- **10 weather states** — clear, partly cloudy, overcast, fog, drizzle, rain, thunderstorm, snow, cherry blossoms, autumn leaves
- **5 climate profiles** detected from your IANA timezone — tropical, arid, temperate, continental, polar
- **Southern-hemisphere flip** — Sydney's July is winter, Bali's January is wet season
- **Per-climate Markov chains** — Bali gets monsoon thunderstorms, Phoenix gets year-round clear skies, Reykjavik gets polar snow, Tokyo gets cherry blossoms in spring
- **Smooth intensity transitions** — weather fades in/out over ~4 seconds instead of popping on/off
- **Wind vector** drives slanted rain, drifting snow, tumbling petals and leaves
- **Thunderstorm** adds lightning flash overlays and delayed thunder SFX
- **Fog** layers a drifting wash with streaks across the viewport
- **Power grid reacts** — solar derates under clouds/storm, wind turbines spin harder during storms and stall in fog
- **Manual override** via `localStorage.setItem('sc_climate', 'polar')` for players who want a different biome

### 🏢 Living City

### 🌌 3D Holomap · 🚇 Metro (4 lines) · 🏠 NPC Housing (44 NPCs) · 🍸 Neon Bar · 🏛️ Billionaire's Row · 🚀 Space Zone · 👻 AI Graveyard · 📊 12 Data Panels · 🔊 Audio · 🏆 21 Achievements · 🌐 The Backbone · 💰 VC Row

### 🖥️ Terminal Mode — the Bloomberg of the AI industry
Press **`D`** (or "Open the Terminal" on the landing page) for a data-only, pixel-art-free dashboard of the entire sim.
- **Command line** — the `⟨GO⟩` bar. Press **`/`** and type a lab, model, country, power source, or a function (`OPENAI`, `LEAD`, `CN`, `POWER`, `TAPE`…). Fuzzy autocomplete, arrow-key nav, Enter to jump or drill in.
- **Persisted memory** — charts remember. Metrics are sampled to `localStorage` across sessions (plus an always-on daily Supabase snapshot), so sparklines show real spans with Δ-vs-24h and all-time highs instead of a 16-second window.
- **Drill-down pages** — click any lab / model / country / power source for a full "security master": benchmark radar, model roster, compute footprint, vitals, bilateral relations, wire mentions. Entities cross-link; **`esc`** backs out.
- **The Tape** — one fused, color-coded wire (news + VC deals + launches + benchmark crownings + policy/bans) as a scrolling ticker and a feed panel.
- **Watchlist + alerts** — pin entities with **☆ WATCH**; an engine diffs their state and fires in-terminal toasts (new flagship, ELO moves, retirements).
- **Light by design** — opening the Terminal pauses the Pixi renderer (no city is drawn) and pumps the sim at ~10 Hz behind the shell, so the data view is cheaper than the city, not heavier.

## Performance

Session 15 (v225-v233) shipped a full perf pass:

- **BitmapText chat bubbles** — no per-frame texture churn from `new PIXI.Text(...)`
- **Off-screen culling** — NPCs/cars/vendors/particles set `.renderable = false` when outside the camera box (with 200px margin). State machines keep ticking; only rendering is skipped.
- **Lazy zone boot** — 6 edge zones (Port, Power, VC Row, Backbone, Robotics, Longevity) defer construction until the camera approaches within ~3 screens.
- **Debug overlay** — press `` ` `` to measure FPS/draw calls/sprites live
